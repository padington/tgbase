# tgbase

A Telegram bot that helps people on the **low-FODMAP diet** systematically reintroduce high-FODMAP foods, one at a time, in three escalating volumes (low → medium → high). Tracks per-user progress, nudges users who go quiet, and produces a report on demand.

## Commands

| Command     | Response                                                                  |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/start`    | Begins or restarts the journey: defecation check → product choice → trial |
| `/about`    | Short bot description (localized)                                         |
| `/report`   | Per-user breakdown: completed / in-progress / not tolerated / interrupted |
| `/abandon`  | Marks the current trial as interrupted; returns to product selection      |
| `/ping`     | `pong` — health check                                                     |
| `/whoami`   | env label, hostname, OS/arch                                              |
| `/menu`     | reply keyboard with `[Ping]` `[Whoami]` shortcuts                         |

## Architecture

```
internal/store      generic key-value Backend (FileBackend, MemoryBackend, DebouncedBackend)
internal/state      per-user UserData on top of store.Backend (key="users")
internal/products   FODMAP catalog with metadata, mutable at runtime (key="products")
internal/settings   reminder/check-in tunables, mutable at runtime (key="settings")
internal/i18n       per-locale UI strings loaded from i18n/<locale>.yaml
internal/journey    Phase-based interaction framework + concrete phases
internal/reminder   scan loop that delegates per-user nudges to journey.Runner
internal/router     Telegram update dispatcher
internal/bot        composition root: wires backend → typed stores → runner
proto/              canonical schemas (state, products, settings, i18n)
```

`products.yaml`, `settings.yaml`, and `i18n/*.yaml` are bundled into the Docker image as first-boot seeds. After first boot the backend (under `DATA_DIR`) is the source of truth — admin commands can mutate products and settings at runtime without a redeploy.

## Flow

### State machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle
    Idle --> AwaitingDefecation : /start (SetupPhase)
    AwaitingDefecation --> AwaitingProductChoice : 1/2/3 → fluid/normal/issues
    AwaitingProductChoice --> AwaitingStageCheckin : pick product
    AwaitingProductChoice --> Idle : catalog exhausted (auto report)
    AwaitingStageCheckin --> AwaitingProductChoice : "yes" → advance / complete
    AwaitingStageCheckin --> AwaitingProductChoice : "no" → not_tolerated
    AwaitingDefecation --> AwaitingDefecation : reminder tick
    AwaitingStageCheckin --> AwaitingStageCheckin : reminder tick (auto-prompts "are you OK?")
```

### Sequence — happy path with reminder

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant Bot
    participant Backend as FileBackend (debounced)

    User->>Bot: /start
    Bot->>Backend: Put users (state=AwaitingDefecation, ChatID, Locale)
    Bot-->>User: "How are things today? 1/2/3" + keyboard

    User->>Bot: 2
    Bot->>Backend: Put users (DefecationState=normal, state=AwaitingProductChoice)
    Bot-->>User: "Pick a food to trial:" + 10-button keyboard

    User->>Bot: Apple
    Bot->>Backend: Put users (CurrentProduct=Apple, CurrentStage=low, state=AwaitingStageCheckin)
    Bot-->>User: "Take 0.25 Apple. I'll check in around 30m."

    Note over Bot: ~30 min elapse, no reply

    Bot->>Bot: reminder.Worker → runner.Remind() → StageCheckinPhase.Remind
    Bot-->>User: "How are you doing after 0.25 Apple? Reply yes or no."
    Bot->>Backend: Put users (CheckinAsked=true)

    User->>Bot: yes
    Bot->>Backend: Put users (CurrentStage=medium, StageStartedAt=now)
    Bot-->>User: "Now take 0.5 Apple."
```

## Prerequisites

- [Go 1.23+](https://go.dev/dl/) (for local development)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (for VPS deployment)
- A Telegram bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)

## Local development

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter the repo
git clone https://github.com/padington/tgbase.git
cd tgbase

# 2. Install dependencies
go mod tidy

# 3. Set your token
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env — fill in TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and BOT_ENV=local

# 4. Run
export $(cat .env | xargs)
go run ./cmd/bot
```

## CI/CD — GitHub Actions + self-hosted runner

Every push to `main` triggers `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which runs on a **self-hosted runner** installed on the VPS. The workflow:

1. Checks out the latest code
2. Builds a fresh Docker image on the VPS
3. Stops and removes the old container
4. Starts a new container with the updated image

```
push to main
    └─► GitHub Actions (deploy.yml)
            └─► self-hosted runner on VPS
                    ├─ docker build -t tgbase .
                    ├─ docker stop tgbot
                    └─ docker run tgbase
```

You can also trigger a deploy manually from the Actions tab or via CLI:

```bash
gh workflow run deploy.yml --repo padington/tgbase
```

### GitHub repository secrets

Configure these at `Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions`:

| Secret               | Description                    |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Token from @BotFather          |

### Self-hosted runner setup (one-time, on the VPS)

1. Go to `Settings → Actions → Runners → New self-hosted runner`
2. Follow the GitHub instructions to download and configure the runner
3. Start the runner — it registers itself with the repo
4. Make sure the runner user is in the `docker` group:
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```
5. Restart the runner so the group change takes effect

## Docker (manual)

```bash
# Build
docker build -t tgbase .

# Run
docker run -d \
  --name tgbot \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -e TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_token_here \
  -e BOT_ENV=vps \
  tgbase

# Logs
docker logs -f tgbot
```

## Environment variables

| Variable             | Required | Default            | Description                                                |
|----------------------|----------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | yes      | —                  | Token from @BotFather                                      |
| `BOT_DEBUG`          | no       | `false`            | Log every Telegram API call                                |
| `BOT_ENV`            | no       | `unknown`          | Label shown in `/whoami` (e.g. `vps`)                      |
| `DATA_DIR`           | no       | derived/in-memory  | Directory for backend JSON files. Empty → in-memory backend|
| `CONFIG_PATH`        | no       | `/config.yaml`     | Boot-time config path (state flush interval, seed paths)   |

## Runtime mutation

Both `products` and `settings` live in the backend, not in the Docker image. After first boot:

- Edit `$DATA_DIR/products.json` (or use a future admin command) → next time `/start` shows the list, the changes appear.
- Edit `$DATA_DIR/settings.json` → reminder timing and default locale change without restart (intervals are sampled every tick).

Bundled `products.yaml` / `settings.yaml` / `i18n/*.yaml` only seed the backend on first boot.

## Localization

UI strings live in `i18n/<locale>.yaml` baked into the image (`en.yaml`, `ru.yaml` ship by default). Product names + notes carry inline `name_localized` / `note_localized` maps so they can be translated alongside the catalog. Each user's locale is detected from `msg.From.LanguageCode` on first `/start` and persisted on `UserData.Locale`.
